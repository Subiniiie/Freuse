        content: "You're studying. You're learning stuff. You pore over books, memorize formulas, and swot up on vocabulary. You sit up late into the night, working on concepts and models, writing papers, and doing exams. After all, you're the future. During your training or further education, you invest a lot of time and effort and miss out on many things. And afterward? After graduating, you'll hopefully be doing your bit to make the world a better place. Deal? Good. So, we'd like to reward you upfront for all your hard work. With discounted backpacks, bags, and laptop sleeves we can help you make a bigger success of your education.",

        content: "We stand for thinking and acting in cycles, which means Black Friday and all the aggressive discounting it entails aren't compatible with our philosophy. That's why we're closing our checkouts and focusing on alternatives. There are countless good reasons for not being part of the Black Friday madness. With its call to OTT consumption, it's a day that helps very few but harms many more, be it socially, ecologically, or economically.

We were actually just looking for suitable workwear for our employees, but then we realized that what we were looking for didn’t even exist – a tough, sustainably produced and compostable material made in Europe. So, we decided to develop our own textiles starting from the fiber up that would fulfill our requirements 100 % – and we decided to call them F‑ABRIC.",
